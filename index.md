The Schrodinger-Week Hackathon has become an annual tradition now, where the **Turing Club** and **φ@I** collaborate to bring you a one of its kind hackathon in computational physics. The hackathon will test your creativity in solving problems, and also require you to use some basic skills from physics in general and computational physics in particular.

You can use any language of your choice, but obviously, Julia and Python are preferred. You can also use different languages for different questions. Make sure you don't use any fancy libraries. You can look into the [rules](./rules) for details.

Before starting please register. We will not be able to accept your solutions without you registering. Each team of maximum 4 people needs to register only once.

Also join the WhatsApp group for doubts, hints etc. Link will be shared on Φ@I and Turing Club groups to prevent spamming.

Feel free to contact the organizers if you need additional information.
